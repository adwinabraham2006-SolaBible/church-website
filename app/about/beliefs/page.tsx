            <p>
              We believe and teach that the Bible is God&apos;s written revelation to man, and thus the 66 books of the Bible given to us by the Holy Spirit constitute the plenary (inspired equally in all parts) Word of God.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">1</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that the Word of God is an objective, propositional revelation,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">2</sup> verbally inspired in every word,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">3</sup> absolutely inerrant in the original documents, infallible, and God-breathed.
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that the Bible constitutes the only necessary and infallible rule of faith and practice and is sufficient for all things pertaining to life and godliness.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">4</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that God spoke in His written Word by a process of dual authorship. The Holy Spirit so superintended the human authors that, through their individual personalities and different styles of writing, they composed and recorded God&apos;s Word to man<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">5</sup> without error in the whole or in the part.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">6</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that, whereas there may be several applications of any given passage of Scripture, there is but one true interpretation — the author&apos;s originally intended meaning, which is binding on all generations. The meaning of Scripture is to be found as one diligently applies the literal, grammatical-historical method of interpretation under the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">7</sup> The literal, grammatical-historical method of interpretation insists on following the normal rules for interpreting all literature, including the priority of context, the normal meaning of words and figures of speech, the rules of grammar and syntax, and the historical context in which the book or passage was written. Although some things in Scripture are hard to understand,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">8</sup> it is sufficiently clear so that when we diligently apply these principles, we are able to discover its meaning<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">9</sup>-especially in those matters that pertain to salvation.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">10</sup>

              <p>
                We believe and teach that Jesus Christ, the second Person of the Trinity, possesses all the divine excellencies, and in these He is coequal, consubstantial (of one and the same essence), and coeternal with the Father.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">1</sup>
              </p>

              <p>

              </p>

              <p>
                We believe and teach that, in the incarnation (God becoming man), the second Person of the Trinity laid aside His right to the full prerogatives of coexistence with God and took on an existence appropriate to a servant while never divesting Himself of His divine attributes.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">3</sup>

              </p>

              <p>
                We believe and teach that in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the grave, God confirmed the deity of His Son and gave proof that God has accepted the atoning work of Christ on the cross.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">15</sup> Jesus&apos; bodily resurrection is also the guarantee of a future resurrection life for all believers.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">16</sup>

          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            <p>
              We believe and teach that man was directly and immediately created by God in His image and likeness. Man was created free of sin with a rational nature, intelligence, volition, self-determination, and moral responsibility to God.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">1</sup> God created man as a two-part being: a material body and an immaterial soul or spirit.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">2</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that God&apos;s intention in the creation of man was that man should glorify God, enjoy God&apos;s fellowship, live his life in the will of God, and by this accomplish God&apos;s purpose for man in the world.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">3</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that in Adam&apos;s sin of disobedience to the revealed will and Word of God, man lost his innocence, incurred the penalty of spiritual, physical and eternal death, became subject to the wrath of God, and became inherently corrupt and utterly incapable of choosing or doing that which is acceptable to God apart from divine grace. With no recuperative powers to enable him to recover himself, man is hopelessly lost. Man&apos;s salvation is thereby wholly of God&apos;s grace through the redemptive work of our Lord Jesus Christ.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">4</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that, because all men were in Adam as their legal representative, the real guilt for Adam&apos;s sin and a corrupt nature have been transmitted to all men of all ages, Jesus Christ being the only exception. All men are thus sinners by nature, by choice, and by divine declaration.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">5</sup>

              <p>
                We believe and teach that election is the act of God by which, before the foundation of the world, He chose in Christ those whom He graciously regenerates, saves, and sanctifies.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">1</sup>
              </p>

              <p>
                We believe and teach that sovereign election does not contradict or negate the responsibility of man to repent and trust Christ as Savior and Lord.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">2</sup> Nevertheless, since sovereign grace includes the means of receiving the gift of salvation as well as the gift itself, sovereign election will result in what God determines. All whom the Father calls to Himself will come in faith, and all who come in faith the Father will receive.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">3</sup>
              </p>

              <p>
                We believe and teach that the unmerited favor God grants to totally depraved sinners in election is unconditional.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">4</sup> That is, it is not conditioned on or related to any human initiative or to God&apos;s anticipation of what they might do by their own will (Matt. 11:21) but is solely of His sovereign grace and mercy.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">5</sup>
              </p>

              <p>
                We believe and teach that election is not based merely on sovereignty in an abstract sense, as if God chooses in isolation from all that He is. God is truly sovereign, but He exercises this sovereignty in harmony with His other attributes, especially His omniscience, justice, holiness, wisdom, grace, and love (Rom. 9:11-16). A proper understanding of divine sovereignty in election will always exalt the will of God in a manner totally consistent with His character, as revealed in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">6</sup>

              <p>
                We believe and teach that every believer is positionally or definitively sanctified (set apart) unto God at salvation and is therefore declared to be holy and identified as a saint. This sanctification is instantaneous and should not be confused with progressive sanctification. Positional sanctification has to do with the believer&apos;s standing, not his present walk or condition.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">1</sup>
              </p>

              <p>
                We believe and teach that the believer is also, by the work of the Holy Spirit, progressively sanctified. Through this gradual process, the state of the believer increasingly draws closer to the standing he enjoys positionally through justification. Through obedience to the Word of God and the empowering of the Holy Spirit, the believer is able to live a life of increasing holiness in conformity to the will of God, becoming more and more like our Lord Jesus Christ.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">2</sup> Although Christians at times behave in a carnal or fleshly way,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">3</sup> we deny that the normative or permanent state of a true believer can be carnal or fleshly.

                In this respect, we believe and teach that every saved person is involved in a daily conflict—the new person he is in Christ doing battle against the flesh—that part of him that remains unredeemed with its beachhead in the body. But adequate provision is made for victory through the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit. The struggle nevertheless stays with the believer all through this earthly life and is never completely ended. All claims to the eradication of sin in this life are unscriptural. However, although eradication of sin is not possible, the Holy Spirit does provide for our victory over sin.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">5</sup>

            The Church
          </h2>

          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
            <p>
              We believe and teach that all who place their faith in Jesus Christ are immediately placed by the Holy Spirit into one united spiritual Body, the church,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">1</sup> the bride of Christ,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">2</sup> of which Christ is the Head.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">3</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that the formation of the church, the Body of Christ, began on the Day of Pentecost<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">4</sup> and will be completed at the coming of Christ for His own at the rapture.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">5</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that the church is thus a unique spiritual organism designed by Christ, made up of all born-again believers in this present age.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">6</sup> The church is distinct from Israel,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">7</sup> a mystery not revealed until this age.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">8</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that the establishment and continuity of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">9</sup> and that the members of the one spiritual Body are directed to associate themselves together in local assemblies.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">10</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that the one supreme authority for the church is Christ<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">11</sup> and that church leadership, gifts, order, discipline, and worship are all appointed through His sovereignty as found in the Scriptures. The biblically designated officers serving under Christ and over the assembly are elders (also called bishops, pastors, and pastor-teachers),<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">12</sup> and deacons, both of whom must meet biblical qualifications<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">13</sup> and carry out their service in a godly manner.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">14</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that these men lead or rule as servants of Christ<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">15</sup> and have His authority in directing the church. The congregation is to submit to their leadership.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">16</sup> At the same time, their leadership must be characterized by a servant&apos;s heart.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">17</sup> The Elder&apos;s primary role is to equip the saints for the work of service which results in the building up of the body of Christ.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">18</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach the importance of discipleship,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">19</sup> mutual accountability of all believers to each other,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">20</sup> as well as the need for the discipline of sinning members of the congregation in accord with the standards of Scripture.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">21</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach the autonomy of the local church, free from any external authority or control, with the right of self-government and freedom from the interference of any hierarchy of individuals or organizations.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">22</sup> It is scriptural for true churches to cooperate with each other for the presentation and propagation of the faith. Each local church, however, through its elders and their interpretation and application of Scripture, should be the sole judge of the measure and method of its cooperation. The elders of a local church are responsible to determine all other matters of membership, policy, discipline, benevolence, and government as well.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">23</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that the ultimate purpose of the church is to glorify God,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">24</sup> which is accomplished only as the church carries out its biblically assigned mission. The church&apos;s primary mission to God is to worship Him and to serve as the pillar and support of His truth.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">25</sup> Its mission to itself is to ensure the mutual care and edification of its members, by instruction in the Word,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">26</sup> by fellowship,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">27</sup> and by the regular practice of the ordinances.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">28</sup> Its mission to the world is to make disciples of all the nations, by communicating the gospel, baptizing them, and by teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">29</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach the need of the church to cooperate with God as He accomplishes His purpose in the world. To that end, He gives the church spiritual gifts. He gives men chosen for the purpose of equipping the saints for the work of the ministry,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">30</sup> and He also gives unique and special spiritual abilities to each member of the Body of Christ,<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">31</sup> calling all saints to the work of service.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">32</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that there were two kinds of gifts given to the early church: miraculous gifts of divine revelation and healing, given temporarily in the apostolic era for the purpose of confirming the authenticity of the apostles&apos; message;<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">33</sup> and ministering gifts, given to equip believers for edifying one another. With the New Testament revelation now complete, confirming gifts of a miraculous nature are no longer necessary.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">34</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that no one possesses the gift of healing today, but that God does hear and answer the prayer of faith and will answer in accordance with His own perfect will for the sick, suffering, and afflicted.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">35</sup> In addition, we believe and teach that the gift of prophecy (in the sense of receiving new revelation directly from God), the gift of tongues, and the gift of the interpretation of tongues have all ceased. However, we acknowledge that miraculous gifts can be counterfeited by Satan so as to deceive even believers.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">36</sup> The only gifts in operation today are the nonrevelatory, equipping gifts given for edification.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">37</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that two ordinances have been committed to the local church: baptism and the Lord&apos;s Supper.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">38</sup> Christian baptism by immersion<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">39</sup> is the solemn and beautiful testimony of a believer showing forth his faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Savior, and his union with Him in death to sin and resurrection to a new life.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">40</sup> It is also a sign of fellowship and identification with the visible Body of Christ.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">41</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
              We believe and teach that the Lord&apos;s Supper is the commemoration and proclamation of His death until He comes, and should be always preceded by solemn self-examination.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">42</sup> We also teach that, whereas the elements of Communion are only representative of the flesh and blood of Christ, participation in the Lord&apos;s Supper is nevertheless an actual communion with the risen Christ, who indwells every believer, and so is present, fellowshipping with His people.<sup className="text-secondary-600 font-semibold">43</sup>
